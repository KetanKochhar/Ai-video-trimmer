To use this video trimming application, follow these steps:

1. Download Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.

2. Install required packages: Open a command prompt (CMD) or terminal and use pip to install the necessary packages: moviepy, numpy, docx, and custom tkinter. You can do this by running the following commands:

```
pip install moviepy numpy docx
pip install customtkinter
```

3. Download the application code: Download the Python code for the video trimming application, including all the necessary files, onto your computer.

4. Launch the application: Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the application code using the command prompt (CMD). Then, run the GUI.py file to start the graphical user interface (GUI) for the program:

```
python GUI.py
```

5. Select the video: Once the GUI opens, click on the "Video Trimming" button. A file dialog will appear; use it to choose the video file that you want to trim(provied in the zip video generated by ai).

6. Video trimming process: After selecting the video, the program will use the moviepy library to scan the video for silent segments and store this information in the temp.txt file(will be created automatically). The trimmed video files will be saved in an "output"(will be created automatically) folder, which will be automatically created in the same directory as the Python program. Be aware that any existing data in the output folder will be lost during this process.

7. Provide RO (Run Order at news channel demo is provied in the zip"ro.docx"): The program will prompt you to provide a "RO" (Run Order) from the output folder. This is to associate a name with the trimmed video files, as the program generates random names initially. You can provide this information by selecting a corresponding file from the output folder that represents the content of the trimmed video.

Please note that the program also appears to have some additional functionality, like uploading the trimmed videos to YouTube. However, this part seems to have been dropped due to your neighbor's concerns and other personal commitments.

In summary, this video trimming application automates the process of detecting silence in a video and creating trimmed video files. It's designed to improve the efficiency of video processing and can be useful for news channels or any other content creators who need to produce shorter video clips for social media or other platforms. However, it's essential to be mindful of any potential impact on jobs or other ethical considerations while using such automation tools.

Why to use these pip only

MoviePy is a versatile library for video editing, including command-line video editing. It offers a wide range of features, including the ability to remove audio from a video. This capability is advantageous compared to using FFmpeg for converting file formats and manually analyzing files.

The inclusion of the docx library in the application allows for reading and detecting sentences in bold text within a DOCX file. This approach is beneficial as it enables extracting the headline of the news, which can be used as the name for the video file in the output folder. This method provides a more structured and consistent way of naming the video files compared to a simple open file command.
